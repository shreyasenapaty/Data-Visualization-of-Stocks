# Data-Visualization-of-Stocks
A simple data visualtization project where I analysed the correlation between different factors affecting NIFTY 50 stocks including a specific analysis of indicators and variables TCS stock depends.
I also picked up 4 stocks of the tech sector and analysed them in an effort to show which one would be better to invest in and whether you should select only 1 or multiple stocks from this same sector.
